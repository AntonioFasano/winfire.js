<p>Winfire helps managing Windows Firewall, setting per interface rules.<br />You can use it interactively or inside your own scripts for creating Windows Firewall rules.</p>
<p>Winfire has been tested under Windows 7. It is based on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff956124">Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Interfaces</a>. The minimum supported client for this API is Windows Vista and the minimum supported server is Windows Server 2008. Winfire is based on JScript for Microsoft .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Note: You need elevated privileges to modify Windows Firewall settings and so for <code>winfire</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run-winfire-in-your-favourite-shell">How to run winfire in your favourite shell</h2>
<p>The command examples presented here are based on the native Windows PowerShell. To distinguish command lines from their output the former are are prefixed with <code>PS&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If you choose another shell modify the commands accordingly. Whatever your preferences, always <em>open the chosen shell with elevated privileges</em>.</p>
<p>The best way for most users should be to run <code>winfire.exe</code> 64 bit executable. In case you are still on a 32 bit system, turn to <code>winfire-any.exe</code>.</p>
<h3 id="build-your-own-winfire-executable">Build your own winfire executable</h3>
<p>To make <code>winfire.js</code> into an executable, assuming that <code>winfire.js</code> is in your current directory, use:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v&lt;last-version&gt;\jsc.exe .\winfire.js</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;last-version&gt;</code> with the last version available in you system. You may get it straight via the shell auto-completion. Anyway, if you have changed the default Windows installation, print the available .Net directories with (they all start with a 'v'):</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; dir $env:windir\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v*</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is also an x86-folder <code>Microsoft.NET\Framework</code></p>
<p>As an alternative, to find <code>jsc.exe</code> path you may use:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; cscript.exe buildme.js /find </code></pre>
<p>With:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; cscript.exe buildme.js  </code></pre>
<p>You will build a Win64 exe, an any-platform exe and create the <code>readme.html</code> doc, which requires <a href="johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> availability on your system.</p>
<p>After building <code>winfire.exe</code>, try if it works with:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; winfire /help</code></pre>
<p>You may want to use also the <code>netcat.ps1</code> unit test (see see <a href="#sample-script">Sample script</a> ahead).</p>
<h3 id="winfire.js-as-a-wsh-script">winfire.js as a WSH script</h3>
<p>While you may find the best way to use winfire is to run its executable version, the source code is engineered in such a way that you can also run the JScript source <code>winfire.js</code> as a <code>cscript</code>-script via Microsoft Windows Scripting Host (WSH).</p>
<p>If for some reason you prefer to run winfire.js as WSH script, assuming that winfire is in your path, the <em>long</em> way to run it querying for help is:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; cscript winfire.js /help</code></pre>
<p>This is because by default Windows runs scripts with the GUI based <code>WScript</code> engine. To simplify, you might change the defaults via:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; $sys=&quot;$env:SystemRoot\System32\cscript.cmd&quot;
PS&gt; echo &quot;@cscript.exe //nologo %*&quot; | out-file -encoding ASCII $sys
PS&gt; cmd /c ftype jsfile=cscript.cmd &quot;%1&quot; %*
jsfile=cscript.cmd %1 %*</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run winfire with the simpler:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; winfire /help</code></pre>
<p><em>Beware</em>: use <code>winfire.js</code>, if you have also <code>winfire.exe</code> in your path.</p>
<p>Note that the change of default engine is persistent. If you want to restore the original <code>WScript</code> association, just use:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; cmd /c ftype jsfile=wscript.exe &quot;%1&quot; %*</code></pre>
<h3 id="more-on-the-differences-between-winfire.js-and-winfire.exe">More on the differences between winfire.js and winfire.exe</h3>
<p><code>winfire.js</code> code is written so that it can be run as a WSH script or compiled with the Microsoft <code>jsc</code> compiler, which is already on your system.</p>
<p>Building <code>winfire.exe</code> is a matter of seconds. So, even assuming you need to adapt often the script for some special needs, it is convenient to recompile it again.</p>
<p>When you run the script via WSH, it is interpreted, so it will be a tad slower; beside you are using an older version version of the JScript language, confront the last line of <code>winfire.js /help</code> and <code>winfire.exe /help</code> to learn about the version in use.</p>
<p>If you call <code>winfire</code> (no extension), when you have both <code>.js</code> and <code>.exe</code> available in your path, the latter will have the precedence.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-winfire-commands">Getting started with winfire commands</h2>
<p>To add and enable the rule <code>myrule</code>, which allows <code>c:\myapp</code> to open the listening TCP 2300 port on the Local Area Connection:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /rule-add:myrule /app:c:\myapp /prot-tcp /local-port:2300 /enab /interf:&quot;Local Area Connection&quot;   
Using profile: Private Profile, Public Profile</code></pre>
<p>If a profile is not specified, the rule is active on any available profile, hence the command output.</p>
<p>Note the colons after the options and quotations for including spaces.<br />It possible to attach to rule to more interfaces with separating names with commas and <em>no spaces</em>, e.g.: <code>/interf:&quot;Local Area Connection,Mobile Broadband Connection&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Windows Firewall (and so winfire) accepts more rules with the same name.</p>
<p>While here I will mostly use long version commands, winfire commands can be shortened (see command reference). Indeed the previous line can be also written as:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /ra:myrule /app:c:\myapp /tcp /lp:2300 /enab /if:&quot;Local Area Connection&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The interface or connection name, which is localised for your system language, can be found in the Network Connection folder, perhaps opened with <code>ncpa.cpl</code> (the word 'connection' is normally preferred when the interface is a modem).</p>
<p>Anyway you can get the full list via:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /con-show</code></pre>
<p>If you don't know the exact name for a connection, but you know it is identified by the substring 'local' (case insensitive), you will get it with:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /con-show:local</code></pre>
<p>Therefore you may add a rule for the local connection, whose full name you don't know, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; $lan=.\winfire /con-show:local
PS&gt; .\winfire /ra:myrule /app:c:\myapp /tcp /lp:2300 /enab /if:$lan</code></pre>
<p>If you want details on the rule just added (and to check winfire did the job properly):</p>
<pre><code>PS &gt; .\winfire /rule-show:myrule                          
myrule                                                    
Description:            Created by winfire

Application Name:       c:\myapp                          
Service Name:                                             
Protocol:               TCP                               
Local Ports:            2300                              
Remote Ports:           *                                 
LocalAddresses:         *                                 
RemoteAddresses:        *                                 
Direction:              In                                
Enabled:                true                              
Edge Traversal:         false                             
Action:                 Allow                             
Grouping:                                                 
Interface Types:        All                               
Interfaces:             Local Area Connection </code></pre>
<p>You can customise the &quot;Created by winfire&quot; line via the <code>/desc:DESC</code> option.<br />If there are more rules with the same name, the last added will be displayed first.</p>
<p>To list all the rules relating to a specific connection use:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /rule-show:$lan </code></pre>
<p>where <code>$lan</code> is the variable set before for the local connection.<br />This command will return <code>myrule</code> and possibly other rules associated with this connection.</p>
<p>To list all rules in a grep friendly way you use <code>/rule-show /grep</code>. This will give a detailed rule list (like with <code>/long</code>) where every row is prefixed with the rule name plus <code>==</code>. For example here:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /rule-show /grep | grep &quot;^Windows Media Player.*==Description&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You grep-filter the output by rules whose name starts with <code>Windows Media Player</code> and by the rows containing the <code>Description</code> field.</p>
<p>Note that I assume you have some grep utility in your path. If you don't, try the Windows standard <code>find</code>.</p>
<p>To delete the rule just created:</p>
<pre><code>PS&gt; .\winfire /rule-del:myrule  

Found 1 time(s) myrule       
Removed one: myrule          </code></pre>
<p>To understand the output, remember that Windows allows to add more rules with the same name. If you have <em>n</em> of them, you have to use <code>/rule-del</code> <em>n</em> times. Normally the last rule added will be removed first.</p>
<h3 id="a-sample-script">A sample script</h3>
<p>Given its command line nature, winfire fits to be added to scripts for adding firewall rules.</p>
<p>Have a look at <code>netcat.ps1</code>. It is an interactive unit test script, which will authorise <code>netcat</code> network tool to open and start a chat via the <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> Virtual interface (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly">host-only</a>) and deny the port access via the other interfaces, e.g. LAN, Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">Netcat</a> is a classic net testing tool already available out of the box in Linux. For Windows you may use the <a href="https://cygwin.com/packages">Cygwin</a> version or a native executable, such as the one coming with <a href="http://nmap.org/">nmap</a> application.</p>
<p>Note that under Linux/Cygwin netcat name is <code>nc</code>, while in Windows it is normally <code>ncat.exe</code>.</p>

                  For outbound packets ADDR is matched againist the Source IP field.
                  ADDR can be
                  any:              matches any IP address
                  IPAddress:        matches only the exact IPv4 or IPv6 IP
                  &quot;SUBNET/MASK&quot;:  matches any IPv4/IPv6 part of the SUBNET (mandatory quotes)
                                    MASK is the number of bits in the subnet mask or the subnet mask itself.
                  IPStart-IPEnd:     matches any IPv4/IPv6 falling within this range
                  Multiple entries can be specified in quotes and separating them with a comma and no spaces.
                  If `/local-addr&#39; is not given the default is any.
/lp|/local-port:PORT  packets with matching IP port numbers match this rule.
                  For inbound packets PORT is matched againist the Destination Port IP field.
                  For outbound packets PORT is matched againist the Source Port IP field.
                  PORT can be:
                  any:         matches any value in the port field of the IP packet.
                  Integer(s):  individual numbers from 0 through 65535, a range,
                               or a comma-separated list of numbers and ranges.
                  rpc:         matches inbound TCP packets that are addressed to the listening socket
                               of an application that correctly registers the port as an RPC listening
                               port. A rule with this option must also give /prot-*, dir-* options
                               and possibly /app or /service options
                  rpc-epmap:   matches inbound TCP packets that are addressed to the dynamic RPC
                               endpoint mapper service.
                               It needs the same companion options as `rpc&#39; value&#39; In paricular,
                               (to ensure only the RPC service can send/receive data) use:,

                               If you create a rule /local-port:rpc, then you must also create a rule
                               with `/local-port:rpc-epmap` enabled, to allow both the incoming request
                               to the mapper, and the subsequent packets to the ephemeral ports
                               assigned by the RPC service.
                  Teredo:      Matches inbound UDP packets that contain Teredo packets.
                  iphttps:     Matches inbound TCP packets containing HTTPS with embedded IPv6 packets.
                               iphttps allows IPv6 packets that would otherwise be blocked if sent by
                               using Teredo, 6to4, or native IPv6.
                  Multiple entries can be specified in quotes and separating them with a comma and no spaces
                  If `/local-port&#39; is not specified, the default is any
/prof-domain      The rule is assigned to the domain profile (*)
/prof-private     The rule is assigned to the private profile(*)
/prof-public      The rule is assigned to the public profile (*)
                  (*) You can use more `/prof-*&#39; options
                      The rule will be active when the related profiles are active.
                      If a profile is not specified, the rule is active on any profile.
/tcp|/prot-tcp    packets whose protocol field tcp match this rule

                  ADDR can be
                  any:          Matches any IP address
                  localsubnet:  Matches any IP address on the same IP subnet as the local computer
                  dns|dhcp|wins|defaultgateway: Matches the IP address of any computer configured as
                                                dns, dhcp, wins, default gateway on the local computer

                  If `/remo-port&#39; is not specified, the default is any
/service:SERVICE  traffic generated by service SERVICE matches this rule.
                  SERVICE is the short name from Services snap-in
                  If `/service&#39; is not given, any service matches this rule.
                  If SERVICE is &quot;*&quot;, then any service, but  not an application, matches this rule

Examples in PowerShell:
